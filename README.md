This project showcases a dynamic dropdown list built using HTML, JavaScript, and
Bootstrap 5. The application allows users to add custom options to a dropdown
menu while preventing duplicates and ensuring validation. It also enables users to
remove selected options from the dropdown list. Real-time feedback messages
inform users of successful actions or validation errors, enhancing the overall user
experience. The interface is styled using Bootstrap for a clean and responsive
design, demonstrating how client-side validation, DOM manipulation, and form
interactivity can be implemented effectively in web development.
